    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName}, 

Thank you for your inquiry regarding your deposit with Stox 
Your remittance has yet to be received in our Bank Account. Please remember it can take 3-5 business days to receive funds. 

There may be a number of reasons for this: 

a.	No SWIFT was sent to Stox to identify the transfer 
b.	You sent your SWIFT via a different email address to the one in your Stox account. 
c.	There is a delay at your bank or the intermediary banks 

If you have not already sent the SWIFT conformation please either 
a.	Upload via your account or 
b.	Open a case and upload your SWIFT in the case. 
c.	Send a copy to support@stox.com
 
Please make sure that you 
1.	Use the same email that you registered your Stox account 
2.	State your “Username” 

We wish you all the best with your investments 
Stox Support Team</textOnly>
